## Usage 

After the page is displayed, clicking the "Generate Password" button will start the process.
A confirmation prompt will initially be given to ensure the user wants to generate a password.
If the user has confirmed they want a password, further individual prompts will be given to the user for:
- Enter the maximum number of characters for the password. This must be from 8 to 128 characters.<br>
The following 4 prompts will then be given to the user. At least one of them must be selected.
- To confirm if the user wants to use lowercase characters.
- To confirm if the user wants to use uppercase characters.
- To confirm if the user wants to use numbers.
- To confirm if the user wants to use special characters.<br>
The system will then generate the password and then display it to the user.
